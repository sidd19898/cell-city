          to its conflict of law provisions.
        </p><br>
        <p>
          Our failure to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not
          be considered a waiver of those rights. If any provision of these
          Terms is held to be invalid or unenforceable by a court, the remaining
          provisions of these Terms will remain in effect. These Terms
          constitute the entire agreement between us regarding our Service and
          supersede and replace any prior agreements we might have had between

        <h2>18. <strong>Changes To Service</strong></h2>

          We reserve the right to withdraw or amend our Service, and any service
          or material we provide via Service, in our sole discretion without
          notice. We will not be liable if for any reason all or any part of
          Service is unavailable at any time or for any period. From time to
          time, we may restrict access to some parts of Service, or the entire
          Service, to users, including registered users.
        </p>
        <br>

        <h2>19. <strong>Amendments To Terms</strong></h2>
        <br>
        <p>
          We may amend Terms at any time by posting the amended terms on this
          site. It is your responsibility to review these Terms periodically.
        </p><br>

          Terms means that you accept and agree to the changes. You are expected
          to check this page frequently so you are aware of any changes, as they
          are binding on you.
        </p><br>
        <p>
          By continuing to access or use our Service after any revisions become
          effective, you agree to be bound by the revised terms. If you do not

        <br>
        <p>
          No waiver by Company of any term or condition set forth in Terms shall
          be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such term or condition or
          a waiver of any other term or condition, and any failure of Company to
          assert a right or provision under Terms shall not constitute a waiver
          of such right or provision.
        </p><br>
        <p>
          If any provision of Terms is held by a court or other tribunal of
          competent jurisdiction to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable for any
          reason, such provision shall be eliminated or limited to the minimum
          extent such that the remaining provisions of Terms will continue in
          full force and effect.
